**Strengths**: Strong technical foundation, clear problem-solution fit, good traction
**Weaknesses**: Weak team presentation, missing competitive analysis, unclear differentiation, financials need validation

---

## 1. STRUCTURE & FLOW (7/10)

### ✅ Strengths
- Logical progression: Problem → Solution → Market → Product → Business → Team → Financials
- Good use of section dividers
- Appropriate slide count (~20 slides)

### ❌ Weaknesses
- **Missing hook**: No compelling opening hook or value proposition

## FINAL VERDICT

**Current State**: Good technical foundation, but weak on business fundamentals
**Investor Readiness**: 6/10 - Needs work before serious fundraising
**Key Gap**: Missing competitive analysis and team credibility
**Biggest Risk**: Appears to be a "solution looking for a problem" without customer validation

**Recommendation**: 
- Add competitive analysis and strengthen team slide immediately
- Get 10-20 beta users and testimonials before next pitch
- Validate pricing with potential customers
- Develop clear go-to-market strategy

The deck shows promise but needs significant work on business fundamentals before it's investor-ready.
