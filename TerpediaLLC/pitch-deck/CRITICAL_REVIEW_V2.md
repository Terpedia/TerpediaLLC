## FINAL VERDICT

**Status**: Significantly improved from initial version
**Investor Readiness**: 7.5/10 - Good but not ready yet
**Time to Ready**: 2-3 weeks with focused effort

3. Product screenshots (1 day to add)

**Strengths**:
- Strong technical foundation
- Clear differentiation
- Good market opportunity
- Comprehensive deck structure

**Weaknesses**:
- Team credibility (no bios)
